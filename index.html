        <h2> The History of Ford Motor Company </h2>
        
        <h3>
        Ford Motor Company, founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903, revolutionized the automobile industry by making cars affordable and accessible to the masses. Ford introduced mass production techniques, particularly the moving assembly line, which dramatically lowered manufacturing costs and increased efficiency.
        </h3>

        <h3>
        The company's first major success was the Model T, introduced in 1908. The Model T was a simple, durable, and affordable car that became incredibly popular, making Ford the largest automaker in the world by the 1920s.
        </h3>

        <h3>
        Ford's innovations extended beyond production techniques; in 1914, Ford introduced the $5 workday, doubling the average wage at the time, which helped foster a growing middle class and increased consumer demand for cars.
        </h3>

        <h3>
        Throughout the 20th century, Ford continued to evolve, introducing iconic models like the Mustang in 1964, the F-Series trucks, and the development of advanced safety and fuel-efficient technologies. The company also faced challenges, including financial struggles in the 2000s and competition from global automakers.
        </h3>

        <h3>
        Today, Ford remains one of the largest and most influential automakers in the world, with a strong focus on sustainability, electric vehicles, and cutting-edge technology.
